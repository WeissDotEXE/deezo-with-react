# Deezo (made with react)
Deezo is a simple banking app made with Html, ReactJs , SaSS.
I was inspired by Revolut app after realizing that it does not have a desktop version.

  In Deezo, user can do the following things:
  1. create an account
  2. deposit money
  3. adding friends
  4. sending money to friends
  5. generating a random card with different styles (black , white and transparent)
  6. see transaction history (adding and sending money)
  7. converting money (from USD/Euro/Ron to USD)

  I used React Js for this project due to following reasons:
  1. it is faster than vanilla Javascript to develop
  2. it is a nice way to improve my skills
  3. no need to duplicate html code
  4. easy to implement dynamic data
  5. rendering dynamic css module

The major problems that I faced when creating this web app was passing data from component to component (from parent to child and vice-versa)


HOW TO INSTALL the project:
  1. install NodeJs
  2. Download the Code
  3. In terminal , run 'npm install'
  4. In terminal, run 'npm start'
