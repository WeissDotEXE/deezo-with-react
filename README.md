# Deezo (made with react)
Deezo is a simple banking app made with Html, ReactJs , SaSS.
I was inspired by Revolut app after realizing that it does not have a desktop version.

  In Deezo, user can do the following things:
  -create an account
  -deposit money
  -adding friends
  -sending money to friends
  -generating a random card with different styles (black , white and transparent)
  -see transaction history (adding and sending money)

  I used React Js for this project due to following reasons:
  -it is faster than vanilla Javascript to develop
  -it is a nice way to improve my skills
  -no need to duplicate html code
  -easy to implement dynamic data
  -rendering dynamic css module

The major problems that I faced when creating this web app was passing data from component to component (from parent to child and vice-versa)


HOW TO INSTALL the project:
  1.install NodeJs
  2.Download the Code
  3.In terminal , run 'npm install'
  4.In terminal, run 'npm start'
